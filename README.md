Overview
This repository contains scripts to process genome data, reformat input files, split chromosomes into segments, and count ambiguous base pairs. The process is divided into two main steps: reformatting the input file and then splitting the chromosomes.

To reformat the input file, run reformat.py.

To create .csv files, run testsplit.py.
